## Acknowledgement

#### [Staticman](https://staticman.net)

Staticman _(developed by [Eduardo Bouças](https://eduardoboucas.com))_ and Stapsher both tries to solve the same problems.

The main difference is, currently, Staticman supports only GitHub.

Initially, I thought of adding support for other SCM platforms into Staticman. But then realized a complete rewrite would be better fit for the task. Thus, Stapsher is born.

So, a huge thanks goes to [Eduardo Bouças](https://github.com/eduardoboucas) and all the [awesome contributors](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/graphs/contributors) of Staticman.
